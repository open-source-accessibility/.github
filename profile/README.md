# Open Source Accessibility

We are building a movement to create a space for partnership with leaders from the disability, accessibility, and open source communities to collaborate, share insights, and drive meaningful change across the ecosystem.

This a community-led initiative that will launch at the [Open Source Accessibility Summit](https://2025.allthingsopen.org/open-source-accessibility-summit) on Oct 12, 2025. 

Join the conversation in the [Open Source Accessibility Slack ](https://join.slack.com/t/opensourceacc-kab3997/shared_invite/zt-39veighf6-ANp0KNyuMnITxGYMGCGFIA).

More details coming soon...

🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
